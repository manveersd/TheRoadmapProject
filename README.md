# TheRoadmapProject

This project will serve as a roadmap for my journey to re-learn web-development including all the advancement since I studied it few years ago. 
I will be recalling and improving upon my knowledge of different steps beginning from simple HTML and Javascript, all the way to deployment with database integration, authentication and everything in between.

Here is the Roadmap: 
## Basic Structure (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
Start with a basic portfolio website with sections like "About Me," "Projects," and "Contact."

## Frontend Framework (React)
Convert your site into a React application.
Create reusable components for sections (e.g., header, footer, project cards).

## Styling Enhancements (CSS Framework)
Use Tailwind CSS to style your components.
Make the layout responsive.

## Backend Setup (Node.js & Express)
Set up an Express server.
Create API routes for fetching blog posts and project data.

## Database Integration (MongoDB/PostgreSQL)
Add a database to store blog posts and project data.
Create a simple CMS feature to add/edit blog posts.

## Authentication
Implement JWT-based authentication for a protected "Admin" page.
Allow login to manage blog posts directly on the platform.

## API and SSR/SSG (Next.js)
Migrate to Next.js for server-side rendering of dynamic pages like blog posts.
Use SSG for static pages (e.g., home, about).

## Testing and Deployment
Write unit tests for components, API tests for backend.
Deploy the site using Vercel or Netlify, with CI/CD setup.

## Extra Features
Add a "Like" or "Comment" feature for blog posts.
Track site analytics for visitor insights.
