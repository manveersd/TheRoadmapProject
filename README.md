# TheRoadmapProject

This project will serve as a roadmap for my journey to re-learn web-development including all the advancement since I studied it few years ago. 
I will be recalling and improving upon my knowledge of different steps beginning from simple HTML and Javascript, all the way to deployment with database integration, authentication and everything in between.
