# Process of Development

### Define Purpose and Goals

- Clarify the website's purpose and what you want users to accomplish. This guides all other decisions.

### Plan the Content and Pages

- List out the essential pages (e.g., Home, About, Contact, Blog) based on your goals. Decide what content each page will contain.

### Create a Sitemap

- Organize the pages into a sitemap, which shows the websiteâ€™s structure. This helps you see the flow of navigation and how users will move through the site.

### Sketch Wireframes

- Make rough sketches of each page layout. Focus on positioning the main elements without worrying about style. This sets the layout for important sections.

### Decide on Aesthetics (Mood Board & Style Guide)

- Decide on the color scheme, typography, and overall style (e.g., minimalist, playful). Creating a mood board or style guide can help clarify the look and feel.

### Design High-Fidelity Mockups

- Use a tool like Figma or Adobe XD to create detailed mockups of each page with chosen aesthetics, ensuring everything looks cohesive.

### Develop and Code

- Start building the site. Begin with setting up the main layout and structure, then add content, styling, and functionality in phases.

### Test and Refine

- Test for responsiveness, accessibility, and usability. Make adjustments based on testing results.
